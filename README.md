vagrant-base
============

Starting configurations for vagrant boxes. These are to be non-project specific
but give a foundation for starting new projects that will match other PayTrace 
projects without doing either copying another project's version and trying to 
modify it or starting from scratch everytime. 

Different types of servers can have their own folder to jump start specific 
language configurations.
